The project is to simulate an airline reservation system by using java eclipse. 
There are two types of user for this system, customers and admins. 
Customer could search flight information and book flight-ticket through this system. 
Admins could do  same things as customers but has more privileges, such as adding or deleting flights. 
New customers should register first before logging in their account. 
Upon logging in, if customers forget their password, they could find their password back by answering security questions. 
After their logged in their account, their previous booked flight information should be there in his/her account. 
On the main menu, users could do certain activities by entering corresponse numbers.
